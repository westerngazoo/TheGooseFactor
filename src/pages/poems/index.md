# Poems

Welcome to the poems section. Add your own poems as separate Markdown files under `src/pages/poems/`.

## Collection

- [Your first poem](/poems/primer-poema) — a placeholder page to paste your content.

---

Tips
- Create one file per poem in `src/pages/poems/` (e.g., `my-poem.md`).
- Use frontmatter with `title:` and optionally `slug:` to control the URL.
