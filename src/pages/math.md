# Math & Physics

This section will gather concise, high–impact notes, derivations, and problem‑solving patterns that support algorithmic thinking and systems design.

## Focus Areas

### Mathematics
- Discrete math refresh (sets, relations, functions, logic)
- Counting & combinatorics patterns
- Number theory snippets (mod math, inverses, CRT intuition)
- Graph theory concepts tied to algorithms
- Linear algebra primitives for optimization & graphics
- Probability essentials for randomized algorithms

### Physics
- Kinematics & dynamics formulas as reusable building blocks
- Energy / momentum conservation patterns (problem framing)
- Dimensional analysis as a debugging tool
- Computational physics snippets (time stepping, stability intuition)
- Statistical mechanics analogies for search / optimization heuristics

## Goals
- Minimal fluff: definitions → intuition → canonical examples.
- Bridge: show how a math/physics concept maps to an algorithmic technique.
- Reusability: export small LaTeX/Markdown blocks to reuse in other docs.

## Structure (Living Outline)
1. Logic & Proof Micro‑Toolkit
2. Modular Arithmetic & Fast Exponentiation
3. Combinatorics Patterns (Binomial, Stars & Bars, Inclusion–Exclusion)
4. Probability Tricks (Linearity, Indicator RVs, Tail Bounds Intuition)
5. Graph Theory Core (Cuts, Flows, Matchings – intuition first)
6. Linear Algebra Sparks (Rank, Nullity, Projections, Spectral Glimpse)
7. Continuous Math Bridge (Series approximations, smoothness, convexity)
8. Physics Modeling Primitives (F=ma discretized, harmonic oscillator)
9. Energy Methods & Invariants (How to “see” conserved quantities)
10. Dimensional Analysis & Scaling Arguments
11. Monte Carlo & Physical Analogies (Random walks, diffusion, annealing)
12. Optimization Landscapes vs Physical Potentials

## Contribution Guide
If you add content:
1. Keep sections atomic; prefer cross‑linking over duplication.
2. Start with Intuition, then Formal, then Example, then “Algorithmic Touchpoints.”
3. Add quick sanity checks (edge cases / limit behavior).
4. Tag open questions or TODOs with `TODO:` so they surface in search.

## TODO Backlog
- Add template section format
- Seed first three sections
- Cross‑link to C++ Algorithms pages once anchors stable
