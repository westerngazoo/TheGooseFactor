# Embedded Systems Programming: C++ vs Rust

> A comprehensive guide to embedded development featuring dual implementations on the same hardware platform. Learn embedded programming through direct comparison of C++ and Rust approaches.

## Overview

This book takes a unique approach to embedded systems programming by implementing the same projects in both C++ and Rust on identical hardware. Each chapter presents both implementations side-by-side, allowing you to:
