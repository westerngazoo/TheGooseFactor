# Sci‑Fi Book Project (Early Exploration)

> Narrative universe incubator. Expect raw fragments.

## Vision
A grounded techno-mythic setting exploring:
- Emergent AI folklore
- Memory markets & cognitive barter
- Bio-synthetic avian swarms (because geese)
- Edge habitats: orbital wetlands & megastructure reefs

## Artifacts (Planned)
- Character briefs
- Timeline shards
- Technology dossiers
- Lexicon (in-world terminology)

## Structure Ideas
1. Fractal novella arcs (self-contained but interlinked)
2. Interleaved technical Appendix “diegetic whitepapers”
3. Non-linear reading paths with recursion markers

## Current Status
Collecting concept seeds offline; first public excerpt coming after outline solidifies.

## Contribute / Feedback
Open a discussion with the tag `scifi-book` for: plausibility questions, tech extrapolation critiques, or worldbuilding suggestions.
