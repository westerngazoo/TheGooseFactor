# About The Goose Factor

Hi, I'm the human behind the geese. The Goose Zone is a cluster of personas that mirror the things I like learning and building. Different geese, same mind—each one gets a lane:

## The Resident Geese
- **Philosopher Goose** – Chews on systems thinking, epistemology of engineering, naming things without making them worse.
- **Embedded Systems Goose** – Bare‑metal tinkering, timing diagrams, memory maps, interrupt latency, making hardware behave.
- **Math & Physics Goose** – Derivations, invariants, dimensional analysis, probabilistic intuition feeding algorithms.
- **C++ Algorithms Goose** – Data structures, performance experiments, cache lines, templates (the tasteful kind), invariants & benchmarks.
- **Weightlifting Goose** – Progressive overload, recovery, biomechanics analogies applied back to code (stress, adaptation, limits).

They rotate depending on what I'm exploring. Sometimes they collaborate; sometimes they heckle each other.

## What This Place Is
An evolving lab notebook: code experiments, algorithmic write‑ups, math/physics snippets, design reflections, occasional lore fragments.
